## Issues encountered during deployment
- We used to use the RDS as the database to support applications. But this time we are

## Features

  - Post /tasks/{id}/images 
    - Users should be able to upload images that are associated with tasks.
  - Get /tasks/{id}

  - When the server receives the full size image, save the resized image url to database too.
